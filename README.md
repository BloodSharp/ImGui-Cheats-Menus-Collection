# ImGui Cheats Menus Collection

This is a repository which contains several menus designed using ImGui inspired by several popular cheats for video games. Please feel free to watch the menus online right here: [https://bloodsharp.github.io/ImGui-Cheats-Menus-Collection/](https://bloodsharp.github.io/ImGui-Cheats-Menus-Collection/)

## Clarification

This repository just have a custom implementation from those several cheats menus, but not the actual code.

### Important
There is an exception to the previous clarification, because HPP source code has been leaked several years ago, the code on this public repository is a portion of the original leaked code but updated to ImGui version 1.90, the original code uses ImGui version 1.63 meaning there are still several breaking changes and not everything is working right now.
